# fooder-webpack-project.
Simple single page JS app letting you search and save the recipes in your local storage if you like.
The app suggests a recipe list based on your local time: breakfast, lunch, dinner, night snack as a starting point.
I used freely available Edamam API for this project.

Deployed and ready to use at: https://recipefinder-e050c.web.app/
